In this project, a movie ticket sales application was made using the Python Flask Framework.

You can log in with 2 different roles, Admin and User. When the administrator logs in, he can add or delete a new session by selecting the movie name, hall, date and time.
When the user logs in, he can buy tickets by choosing among the sessions added by the administrator.
In addition, it can view the summary information and trailers of the movies without logging in or by doing it.
